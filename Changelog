Changes made from the "0.1" release to the "0.1.1" release:
-----------------------------------------------------------

- QuesoGLC now uses Doxygen for its documentation.

Changes made from the "Birth" release to the "0.1" release:
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Get rid of NDBM : Unicode names are now stored in a const array which is
  automagically built from buildDB.py
- FreeType lists are now used for the string list object, master lists,
  font lists, current font lists and texture object lists.
- A mutex is now used for every access to the database since NDBM is not
  thread-safe.
- Fixed a bug where the content returned by dbm_fetch() was freed. This
  behaviour was wrong since dbm_fetch() returns static data.
- Now uses NDBM (which is much more portable) instead of GDBM
- Fixed a bug in glcDeleteContext() where QuesoGLC tried to destroy the GL
  objects of the current context instead of those of the context to be deleted.
- Contexts are now stored in a linked list and their number is not limited to
  16 anymore.
- Fixed glcGetAllContexts which returned wrong context IDs and did not zero-
  terminate the array.
- Fixed the error path in __glcInitLibrary where glcCommonArea was freed before
  its members.
- Added many comments to the sources.
- Removed the stupid parameter GLC_INTERNAL_ERROR
- QuesoGLC now computes automatically the resolution of the screen in DPI using
  X window commands.
- The GLC_RESOLUTION parameter now provides a way for the user to choose the
  precision of de Casteljau's algorithm.
- Fixed a bug that occured when a context was deleted : its entry were not
  deleted from the 'stateList' array.
- QuesoGLC now has the ability to use custom memory manager routines
  (see __glcFree, __glcMalloc and __glcRealloc)
- FreeType2 now uses a custom memory manager based on __glcFree, __glcMalloc and
  __glcRealloc. This helps debugging and detection of memory leaks.
- Variables GLC_MIN_MAPPED_CODE, GLC_MAX_MAPPED_CODE, GLC_CHAR_COUNT and the
  list GLC_CHAR_LIST are now updated when a new font file is added to a master.
- Changed license of QuesoGLC to LGPL
- Fixed glcAppendFont so that it raises GLC_PARAMETER_ERROR if the font is an
  element of GLC_CURENT_FONT_LIST at the beginning of the command execution.
- Fixed glcFont so that it behaves correctly if the font parameter is zero.
- Fixed glcFontFace so that it leaves the current face unchanged if it fails to
  set a new face.
- Fixed glcFontMap so that it checks if the character to be mapped is an element
  of the list GLC_CHAR_LIST.
- Fixed glcFontMap so that if no character name is given then the code 'inCode'
  is removed from the charmap.
- Fixed glcRenderCountedString, so that it raises GLC_PARAMETER_ERROR if the
  parameter inCount is less than zero.
- Fixed glcReplacementCode so that it can use a code other than
  GLC_REPLACEMENT_CODE.
- Translated C++ code to pure ANSI C (i.e. get rid of C++)
- QuesoGLC can now be built as a shared library.
