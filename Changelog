Changes made from the "Birth" release to the "Baby" release:
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Added many comments to the sources.
- Removed the stupid parameter GLC_INTERNAL_ERROR
- QuesoGLC now computes automatically the resolution of the screen in DPI using
  X window commands.
- The GLC_RESOLUTION parameter provides now a way for the user to choose the
  precision of the algorithm of de Casteljau.
- Fixed a bug that occured when a context was deleted : its entry were not
  deleted from the 'stateList' array.
- QuesoGLC now has the ability to use custom memory manager routines
  (see __glcFree, __glcMalloc and __glcRealloc)
- QuesoGLC can now be built without the "pthread" library. However the "pthread"
  library is still being mandatory for multi-threading support.
- FreeType2 now uses a custom memory manager based on __glcFree, __glcMalloc and
  __glcRealloc. This helps debugging and detection of memory leaks.
- Variables GLC_MIN_MAPPED_CODE, GLC_MAX_MAPPED_CODE, GLC_CHAR_COUNT and the
  list GLC_CHAR_LIST are now updated when a new font file is added to a master.
- Changed license of QuesoGLC to LGPL
- Fixed glcAppendFont so that it raises GLC_PARAMETER_ERROR if the font is an
  element of GLC_CURENT_FONT_LIST at the beginning of the command execution.
- Fixed glcFont so that it behaves correctly if the font parameter is zero.
- Fixed glcFontFace so that it leaves the current face unchanged if it fails to
  set a new face.
- Fixed glcFontMap so that it checks if the character to be mapped is an element
  of the list GLC_CHAR_LIST.
- Fixed glcFontMap so that if no character name is given then the code 'inCode'
  is removed from the charmap.
- Fixed glcRenderCountedString, so that it raises GLC_PARAMETER_ERROR if the
  parameter inCount is less than zero.
- Fixed glcReplacementCode so that it can use a code other than
  GLC_REPLACEMENT_CODE.
