Changes made fom the "Birth" release to the "Baby" release:
----------------------------------------------------------

- Added many comments to the sources.
- Removed the stupid parameter GLC_INTERNAL_ERROR
- QuesoGLC now computes automatically the resolution of the screen in DPI using
  X window commands.
- The GLC_RESOLUTION parameter provides now a way for the user to choose the
  precision of the algorithm of de Casteljau.
- Fixed a bug that occured when a context was deleted : its entry were not
  deleted from the 'stateList' array.
- QuesoGLC now has the ability to use custom memory manager routines
  (see __glcFree, __glcMalloc and __glcRealloc)
- QuesoGLC can now be built without the "pthread" library. However the "pthread"
  library is still being mandatory for multi-threading support.
- FreeType2 now uses a custom memory manager based on __glcFree, __glcMalloc and
  __glcRealloc. This helps debugging and memory leaks detection more easy.
- Variables GLC_MIN_MAPPED_CODE, GLC_MAX_MAPPED_CODE, GLC_CHAR_COUNT and the
  list GLC_CHAR_LIST are now updated when a new font file is added to a master.
