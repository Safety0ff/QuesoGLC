QuesoGLC 0.0.1

These are things to do by order of preference :

1. Support for Bitmap Fonts (so far QuesoGLC only supports Scalable Fonts).
2. Use Unicode !!! (see www.unicode.org)
3. Use a common area to store the global variables
4. Use display lists if GLC_GL_OBJECTS is enabled
5. Separate platform specific code from the main code set.
6. Improve performance (see 7. for example) !!! (Really needed)
7. Use a cache, in order not to load/unload face files too much
8. Associate a glX context with a glc context.
9. Use doxygen more
10. Do not store the path for each file name ?
11. QuesoGLC do not support face collections in one file.
