QuesoGLC 0.0.1

These are things to do by order of preference :

1. Complete Unicode implementation (add conversion between formats and handle
   GLC funcs with char I/O).
2. Support for Bitmap Fonts (so far QuesoGLC only supports Scalable Fonts).
3. Separate platform specific code from the main code set.
4. Improve performance (see 5. for example) !!! (Really needed)
5. Use FreeType cache system, in order not to load/unload face files too much
6. Associate a glX context with a glc context.
7. Use doxygen more
8. Do not store the path for each file name ?
9. QuesoGLC does not support face collections in one file.
10. Allow QuesoGLC to be built without pthread support (no _REENTRANT flag)
11. Support for loading of compressed files
12. Use of the GLC_RESOLUTION parameter to control the precision of de Casteljau's algorithm
13. Use platform specific functions to determine screen resolution in dpi (WidthMMOfScreen, WidthOfScreen for X-Windows)
14. (?) Get rid of gdbm
15. (?) Use FreeType's double linked lists
16. (?) Use FreeType memory manager in order to use debug memory routines (g_malloc, g_free,...) of the glib
