QuesoGLC 0.0.1

These are things to do by order of preference :

1. Error must be stored in thread local storage
2. Support for Bitmap Fonts (so far QuesoGLC only supports Scalable Fonts).
3. Use Unicode !!! (see www.unicode.org)
4. Separate platform specific code from the main code set.
5. Use a cache, in order not to load/unload face files too much
6. Improve performance !!! (Really needed)
7. Associate a glX context with a glc context.
9. Use doxygen more
