QuesoGLC 0.0.1

These are things to do by order of preference :

1. Write an extensive set of test programs
2. Remove the hard-limited arrays of QuesoGLC (in other words, remove the file
   include/constant.h)
3. Improve performance
   3.1. Use FreeType cache system, in order not to load/unload face files too
	much
   3.2. Use a cache to store the pictures used when drawing glyphs with
	GLC_BITMAP
4. (?) Use FreeType's double linked lists in order to minimize redundant code
5. (?) Get rid of gdbm
6. Make quesoGLC a dynamic library (or a static lib depending on the options
   choosen at the configure time).
7. When a fatal error occurs inside QuesoGLC, it should do something more
   friendly than brute-force exiting.
8. Check that OpenGL is 1.1 or better and glX is 1.2 or better.
9. Try to optimize texture space : draw several glyphs on each texture in order
   to minimize the unused texture space.
10. QuesoGLC does not support face collections in one file.
11. QuesoGLC should use a (big?) database where it stores the masters and fonts
    it has used so far, in order to prevent the (very) long process of parsing
    font files each time it is launched.
12. (?) Support for Bitmap Fonts (so far QuesoGLC only supports Scalable Fonts).
13. Support for loading of compressed files
14. Separate platform specific code from the main code set.
15. (?) Associate a glX context with a glc context.
16. (?) Do not store the path for each file name
17. (?) Use pure ANSI C (or get rid of C++)
