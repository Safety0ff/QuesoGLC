QuesoGLC 0.0.1

These are things to do by order of preference :

1. Write an extensive set of test programs
2. Allow QuesoGLC to be built without pthread support (no _REENTRANT flag)
3. Remove the hard-limited arrays of QuesoGLC (in other words, remove the file
   include/constant.h)
4. Improve performance
   4.1. Use FreeType cache system, in order not to load/unload face files too
	much
   4.2. Use a cache to store the pictures used when drawing glyphs with
	GLC_BITMAP
5. (?) Use FreeType's double linked lists in order to minimize redundant code
6. (?) Get rid of gdbm
7. (?) Use FreeType memory manager in order to use debug memory routines
    (g_malloc, g_free,...) of the glib
8. When a fatal error occurs inside QuesoGLC, it should do something more
   friendly than brute-force exiting.
9. Check that OpenGL is 1.1 or better and glX is 1.2 or better.
10. QuesoGLC does not support face collections in one file.
11. Support for Bitmap Fonts (so far QuesoGLC only supports Scalable Fonts).
12. Support for loading of compressed files
13. Separate platform specific code from the main code set.
14. (?) Associate a glX context with a glc context.
15. (?) Do not store the path for each file name
