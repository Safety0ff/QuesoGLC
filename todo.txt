QuesoGLC 0.0.1

These are things to do by order of preference :

1. Support for Bitmap Fonts (so far QuesoGLC only supports Scalable Fonts).
2. Use Unicode !!! (see www.unicode.org)
3. Use a common area to store the global variables
4. Separate platform specific code from the main code set.
5. Use a cache, in order not to load/unload face files too much
6. Improve performance !!! (Really needed)
7. Associate a glX context with a glc context.
8. Use doxygen more
9. Do not store the path for each file name.
