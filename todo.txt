QuesoGLC 0.0.1

These are things to do by order of preference :

1. Use Unicode !!! (see www.unicode.org)
2. Support for Bitmap Fonts (so far QuesoGLC only supports Scalable Fonts).
3. Separate platform specific code from the main code set.
4. Improve performance (see 5. for example) !!! (Really needed)
5. Use a cache, in order not to load/unload face files too much
6. Associate a glX context with a glc context.
7. Use doxygen more
8. Do not store the path for each file name ?
9. QuesoGLC do not support face collections in one file.
