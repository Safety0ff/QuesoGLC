QuesoGLC 0.0.1

This file contains notes about non-conformance and "extensions" to 
the GLC specs 0.2

Preface
-------
SGI provides the GLC specs 0.2 at www.xxxx.org but they have stayed in a draft
version since 1996 (hence the 0.2 version number) and they are then far from
being complete. Some things are ambiguous or even not documented at all. 

In order to provide a complete, self-consistent libary, I have been led to take
some arbitrary decisions on how to implement some aspects of QuesoGLC. These
choices might or might not be conformant to the specs. Hence the purpose of this
file which is to contain the (hoppefully) complete list of non-conformance and
"extensions" to the specs. By "extensions" I mean things that are not fully
documented in the docs such as the GLC_RESOLUTION state variable for which the
specs does not clearly describe what it is intended for and how it should
interfer on the library behaviour.

Notice that the non-conformance notes are intended to be fixed so that QuesoGLC
becomes fully conformant. However "extensions" issues can not be fixed without
SGI help.
