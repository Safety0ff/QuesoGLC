For now, QuesoGLC can only be built on POSIX platforms (including Linux) as long
as the GNU make tool is installed.

If you have GNU Make installed, simply type

  ./configure
  make
  make install

on the command line to configure, build and install QuesoGLC on your
system. Note that the default installation path is "/usr/local".
