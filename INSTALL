For now, QuesoGLC can only be built on POSIX platforms.

1. What do you need in order to build QuesoGLC :
==============================================

1.1 Tools/headers/libraries that are mandatory :
----------------------------------------------

QuesoGLC depends on tools and libraries that are now widely used in the
Open Source world, and which might already be installed on your favorite
platform. If not, you can get them on Internet and build them on your system.

* GNU Make tool (www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html)
	QuesoGLC's build process heavily rely on this tool. You must install it
	first.
* FreeType2 (www.freetype.org)
	This is the core lib that manage fonts files and datas. QuesoGLC heavily
	uses its functionnalities.
* OpenGL, GLU (www.opengl.org/documentation/implementations.html)
	QuesoGLC is supposed to provide a character rendering service for
	OpenGL. Hence you definitely need OpenGL ;-)
* POSIX threads
	GLC is designed with core support for multi-threading. However,
	QuesoGLC only supports POSIX threads. 'pthread' lib and headers are
	mandatory in order to build QuesoGLC.

1.1 Tools/headers/libraries that are optional :
---------------------------------------------

Not all test programs need GLUT, but some of them need it in order to display
OpenGL graphics.

* Mark Kilgard's GLUT (www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut.html)
	It provides platform independant support for OpenGL. However, QuesoGLC
	can safely be used without GLUT.

2. OK, all those libs and headers are installed on my machine.
What shall I do now ?
=============================================================

Simply type

  ./configure
  make
  make install

on the command line to configure, build and install QuesoGLC on your
system. Note that the default installation path is "/usr/local".

4. Is that all ?
================

When the library has been successfully built, you might define the variable
GLC_PATH in order to indicate QuesoGLC where to find fonts. Depending on your
shell the command is either

export GLC_PATH=/usr/lib/X11/fonts/Type1:/path/to/another/font/directory

or

setenv GLC_PATH /usr/lib/X11/fonts/Type1:/path/to/another/font/directory

Note : the path /usr/lib/X11/fonts/Type1 usually leads to Type1 fonts on almost
all X-window flavor.

5. Is that really all ?
=======================

You should have a look to the README file and get the specifications of GLC
from www.opengl.org/documentation/specs/glc/glcspec.ps.
You should also try the tests programs too.
