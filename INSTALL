For now, QuesoGLC can only be built on POSIX platforms (including Linux).

1. What do you need in order to build QuesoGLC :
==============================================

1.1 Tools/headers/libraries that are mandatory :
----------------------------------------------

* GNU Make tool
	QuesoGLC's build process heavily rely on this tool. You must install it
	first.
* FreeType2 (www.freetype.org)
	It is the core lib that manage fonts files and datas. QuesoGLC heavily
	uses its functionnalities.
* OpenGL, GLU
	QuesoGLC is supposed to provide a character rendering service for
	OpenGL. Hence you definitely need those ones.
* GDBM
	QuesoGLC uses GDBM to manage a database of the official Unicode names
	of characters. However, in the (near?) future, we may get rid of it.
	For now, it is mandatory.

1.2 Tools/headers/libraries that are optional :
---------------------------------------------

* POSIX threads
	QuesoGLC can be built without POSIX threads libs. However if you want to
	use the multi-threaded features of QuesoGLC, you must provide the
	'pthread' headers and libraries.

2. What do you need in order to build tests programs :
--------------------------------------------------

* Mark Kilgard's GLUT
	It provides platform independant support for OpenGL. However, QuesoGLC
	can safely be used without GLUT.

3. OK, all those libs and headers are installed on my machine.
What shall I do now ?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Simply type

  ./configure
  make
  make install

on the command line to configure, build and install QuesoGLC on your
system. Note that the default installation path is "/usr/local".
