For now, QuesoGLC can only be built on POSIX platforms (including Linux).

What do you need in order to build QuesoGLC :
--------------------------------------------

* GNU Make tool
	QuesoGLC's build process heavily rely on this tool. You must install
	first.
* FreeType2 (www.freetype.org)
	It is the core lib that manage fonts files and datas. QuesoGLC heavily
	uses its functionnalities.
* OpenGL, GLU
	QuesoGLC is supposed to provide a character rendering service for
	OpenGL. Hence we definitely need this one.
* POSIX threads
	GLC is designed with core support for multi-threading. However,
	QuesoGLC only supports POSIX threads. 'pthread' lib and headers are
	mandatory in order to build QuesoGLC
* GDBM
	QuesoGLC uses GDBM to manage a database of the official Unicode names
	of characters. However, in the (near?) future, we may get rid of it.
	For now, it is mandatory.

What do you need in order to build tests programs :
--------------------------------------------------

* Mark Kilgard's GLUT
	It provides platform independant support for OpenGL. However, QuesoGLC
	can safely be used without GLUT.

OK, all those libs and headers are installed on my machine.
What shall I do now ?
----------------------------------------------------------

Simply type

  ./configure
  make
  make install

on the command line to configure, build and install QuesoGLC on your
system. Note that the default installation path is "/usr/local".
