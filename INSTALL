QuesoGLC can only be built on POSIX platforms.

1. What do you need in order to build QuesoGLC :
==============================================

1.1 Tools/headers/libraries that are mandatory :
----------------------------------------------

QuesoGLC depends on tools and libraries that are now widely used in the
Open Source world, and which might already be installed on your favorite
platform. If not, you can get them on Internet and build them on your system.

* OpenGL, GLU (www.opengl.org/documentation/implementations.html)
	QuesoGLC is supposed to provide a character rendering service for
	OpenGL. Hence you definitely need OpenGL ;-)
* FreeType2 (www.freetype.org)
	This is the core lib that manage fonts files and datas. QuesoGLC heavily
	uses its functionnalities.
* Fontconfig (www.fontconfig.org)
	Fontconfig is a library for font customization and configuration. It is
	used by QuesoGLC to automagically detect the fonts that are available
	on your system.
* POSIX threads
	GLC is designed with core support for multi-threading. However,
	QuesoGLC only supports POSIX threads. 'pthread' lib and headers are
	mandatory in order to build QuesoGLC.
* GNU Make tool (www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html)
	QuesoGLC's build process heavily rely on this tool. You must install it
	first.

1.2 Tools/headers/libraries that are optional :
---------------------------------------------

QuesoGLC can be safely built and used without GLUT. However, some test programs
need GLUT in order to display OpenGL graphics : if GLUT is not installed on your
system, the examples will not build.

* Mark Kilgard's GLUT (www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut.html)
	It provides platform independant support for OpenGL.

2. OK, all those libs and headers are installed on my machine.
What shall I do now ?
=============================================================

Simply type

  ./configure
  make
  make install

on the command line to configure, build and install QuesoGLC on your
system. Note that the default installation path is "/usr/local". If you want to
install QuesoGLC to another location, use the --prefix option of configure :

  ./configure --prefix=/another/location

By default, QuesoGLC is built as a static library, but it can also be built as a
shared library, in which case you must use the --enable-shared option of the
configure script :

  ./configure --enable-shared

3. Is that all ?
================

When the library has been successfully built, you might define the environment
variable GLC_PATH in order to indicate QuesoGLC where to find fonts. This step
is optional since QuesoGLC uses Fontconfig to locate fonts on your system. You
can however add some additional directories to those detected by Fontconfig.

GLC_PATH is a colon-separated list of directories similar to the PATH
environment variable. Depending on your shell the command is either

export GLC_PATH=/usr/lib/X11/fonts/Type1:/path/to/another/font/directory

or

setenv GLC_PATH /usr/lib/X11/fonts/Type1:/path/to/another/font/directory

Note : the path /usr/lib/X11/fonts/Type1 usually leads to Type1 fonts on almost
all X-window flavor.

4. Is that really all ?
=======================

You should have a look to the README file and to the documentation, especially
to the tutorial. You can also get the specifications of GLC from
www.opengl.org/documentation/specs/glc/glcspec.ps. You should also try the tests
programs too.
